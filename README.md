# My College School Work Repository
Welcome to my repository of college school work! This repository contains a collection of projects, papers, and other materials that I have completed as a student at Sacramento State.

I have organized the repository by course, with each course having its own folder containing the relevant materials. Within each folder, you will find a variety of documents, including project reports, presentations, and other materials related to the course.

I have included this repository as a way to demonstrate my academic skills and achievements, and to provide a portfolio of my work. I hope that you find the contents of this repository interesting and useful, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.
Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you enjoy exploring my college school work!
